This blog was created by adding [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) functionality to the [SSR boilerplate](https://github.com/superlucky84/lithent/tree/master/createLithent/express#welcome-to-lithent-ssr-boilerplate) of [Lithent](https://github.com/superlucky84/lithent), the virtual DOM library I created. All posts, except for the main list page, are written using MDX.

I would like to acknowledge that a significant portion of the design was inspired by and mimics the blogs of the respected [Vercel CEO Guillermo Rauch](https://rauchg.com/) and the equally respected [frontend developer Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/).

The original version of all the articles was written in Korean, and the English version was created using a translation tool, so there may be some awkward phrasing. We kindly ask for your understanding in advance.

The code for this blog is available on [Github](https://github.com/superlucky84/blog)

### About Me

I am a software engineer and a father of a child. I am from Korea. I have built most of my career as a web developer, with a significant portion of my experience in frontend development and open-source contributions.

My primary profession is frontend development, but I started my career as a backend developer in the early stages.

In the beginning, I gained experience with PHP + CodeIgniter, Python + Django, Java + Play Framework, and Java + Spring Framework. Later, I became captivated by the appeal of JavaScript and transitioned into frontend development.

After that, I joined a team that created the open-source project [TOAST UI](https://ui.toast.com/). I continued to enjoy open-source development and created [Lithent](https://github.com/superlucky84/lithent) and [State-ref](https://github.com/superlucky84/state-ref). In particular, [Juho Vepsäläinen](https://survivejs.com/about-me/), one of the core early developers of Webpack, [posted an interview about State-ref](https://survivejs.com/blog/state-ref-interview/) on his personal blog.

Currently, I am part of the frontend development team at [JoongAng Ilbo](https://www.joongang.co.kr/). You can find more details about my career on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/superlucky84/).
